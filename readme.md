# Beginner’s Guide for Tuning Competitive Cars by [HokiHoshi](https://www.youtube.com/@HokiHoshi)

The following table is based on the information from the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw) that HokiHoshi did for Forza Motorsport (2023). All credits go to [HokiHoshi](https://www.youtube.com/@HokiHoshi) for figuring this out together with his mates. I merely put this in a markdown file for my own benefit and decided to share it with the rest of you. Follow [HokiHoshi](https://www.youtube.com/@HokiHoshi) if you don't already on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@HokiHoshi) or [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/hokihoshi).

| Section | Setting | Specific | Base Range | Setting Goal(s) & Tip(s)
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Tires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=118s) | Tire Pressure | | 28 - 32 PSI (30.0)<br /> 1.93 - 2.20 Bar (2.06)  | Goal: Find optimal grip and adjust for steering balance
| | | | | Higher = More responsive, higher peak grip
| | | | | Lower = Smoother loss of grip, can help with LMP cars
| | | | | F↑R↓ = Oversteer
| | | | | F↓R↑ = Understeer
| | | | | Tip: Keep on-track pressure near 32-33 PSI (2.20 - 2.27 Bar)
| [Gearing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=214s) | Final Drive | | 0.0 - 10.0 (4.15) | Goal: Good launch speed
| | | | | Goal: Reduce 'awkward corners'
| | | | | Goal: Do not top out on straights
| | | | | Goal: Stay in optimal powerband
| [Alignment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=341s) | Camber Front | RWD | -0.5 - -2.5 (-1.6) | Maximize tire grip
| | Camber Rear | RWD | -0.5 - -2.5 (-1.3) | Goal: Smooth, consistent corners
| | Camber Front | FWD | -0.5 - -2.5 (-1.3) | Higher = More corner grip, less straight line grip
| | Camber Rear | FWD | -0.5 - -2.5 (-1.6) | Lower = More stability, understeer
| | Camber Front | AWD | -0.5 - -2.5 (-1.4) | Tip: Raise caster for more mid-corner front camber
| | Camber Rear | AWD | -0.5 - -2.5 (-1.4) |
| [Alignment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=341s) | Toe | | -0.5 - 0.5 (0) | Goal: Optimize turn in and rotation while maintaining vehicle stability
| | | | | Out = Turn in/rotation
| | | | | In = Stability
| | | | | Tip: Front toe is usually adjusted out, rear toe in
| [Alignment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=341s) | Caster | | 5 - 7 (6) | Goal: Optimize front camber, tune for feel
| | | | | Higher = More front camber in corners, stability, strong 'self centering' feel
| | | | | Lower = More 'lively' steering on straights/exits
| [Anti-roll bars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=555s) | ALL | | 0 - 40 (40F, 40R) | Goal: Stable transitions while maintaining corner rotation
| | | | | Higher = Responsiveness, less body roll
| | | | | Lower = Smooth response, more body roll
| | | | | F↑R↓ = Understeer
| | | | | F↓R↑ = Oversteer
| | | | | Tip: This setting is very important.
| | | | | Tip: Extremes sometimes work. 1/40 for AWD and 40/1 for RWD maybe viable.
| [Springs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=638s) | Stiffness | | 20 - 60 (50%) | Goal: Find overall stiffness that feels good to you
| | | | | Higher = Responsive, stiff overall feel, more "twichty"
| | | | | Lower = Smooth, softer overall feel, more body roll
| | | | | F↑R↓ = Understeer
| | | | | F↓R↑ = Oversteer
| | | | | Tip: Use F/R balance to dail in on general over/understeer
| [Springs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=638s) | Ride height | | varies (2 - 3 above minimum) | Goal: Find the lowest ride height you can run without hitting curbs
| | | | | Higher = More body roll and suspension travel, better on curbs
| | | | | Lower = Improved center of gravity, grip and stability on smooth track
| | | | | Tip: Keep as low as possible
| | | | | Tip: Can raise rear (rake) to increase rear rotation
| [Damping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=729s) | Bump stiffness | | 2-5 (4F, 4R) | Goal: Find the lowest bump and highest rebound that still allows for stable curbs
| | | | | Tip: Use F/R balance to dial in corner feel
| | | | | Tip: Bump should be raised before rebound if you run into issues on curbs/bumps
| [Damping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=729s) | Rebound stiffness | | 9-13 (11F, 11R) | Goal: Find the lowest bump and highest rebound that still allows for stable curbs
| | | | | Tip: Use F/R balance to dial in corner feel
| | | | | Tip: Rebound can often be maxed
| [Suspension Geometry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=788s) | Roll Center Height | | varies (stock/neutral) | Goal: Fine tune your overall suspension balance
| | | | | Higher = Less suspension movement, less force on springs
| | | | | Lower = More forces applied to springs, more weight transfer
| | | | | Tip: Very powerful
| | | | | Tip: Make sure spring stiffness is set well before adjusting this
| [Suspension Geometry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=788s) | Anti-geometry | | varies (stock/neutral) | Goal: Fine tune your corner entry and exit feel
| | | | | Higher = Stiff body during acceleration/braking, less weight shift
| | | | | Lower = More weight shift during acceleration/braking
| | | | | Anti-dive↑ = Understeer↑
| | | | | Anti-squat↑ = Oversteer↑
| [Aero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=919s) | Downforce | | varies (Max Front, Base Rear/Power/Drivetrain) | Goal: Find the best setting for the rear that gives good control without too much drag
| | | | | Higher = More grip at speed
| | | | | Lower = Less drag
| | | | | Tip: FWD can usually run with minimum rear, RWD will be higher in most cases
| [Brake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=981s) | Balance | | 70-40 (Base/Stock/50%) | Goal: Find a comfortable balance for corner entries
| | | | | Front bias: understeer while braking
| | | | | Rear bias: oversteer while braking
| [Brake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=981s) | Pressure | ABS ON | 100-200 (100%) | Goal: Find the highest setting you are comfortable with; make sure you can still lightly apply the brakes
| | | | | Higher = Faster, harder braking response
| | | | | Lower = Smoother braking response
| | | ABS OFF | 100-200 (85%) | Note: this is my personal preference
| [Differential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=1085s) | Acceleration | FWD | 90-100 | Goal: Find the highest acceleration setting you can run while maintaining grip and control
| | |  FWD / AWD (Front) | 90-100 (95%) | Tip: Higher = Oversteer
| | |  RWD | 50-90 (70%) |
| | |  AWD (Center) | 50-80 (65%) | 
| [Differential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=1085s) | Deceleration | | 0-25 (15%) |  Tip: Higher = Understeer
| [Steering wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT-5Ewo6cpw&t=1147s) | Steering lock range | | 0-100 (100%) | Functions sort of like a slider between the 'Arcade' and 'Simulation' steering options
